# ASSIGNMENT - CUSTOMER PROJECT - TOUGH COOKIE
_"Front End Developer" student at Medieinstituet_
## WHAT I USED
Built with: 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- Grid

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
In this assignment I got images, with two versions of each, of how the webpage should look like in desktop mode. I was instructed to come up with the mobile and tablet layout myself. 
Further instructions included:
- No need for JavaScript. Only HTML and CSS/SCSS.
- The site must be a one-pager. 
- It should be responsive. 
- Color codes: Green 100%, 0%, 78%, 0%. Yellow 0%, 5%, 79%, 0%. Cancel-button in the formular 263Â°, 100%, 73%.
- Fonts: Jockey One and Roboto Condensed.
- When the pointer is hovering over the lettuce image, the arrow will move down a bit in a snappy way. Not too fast, not too slow. 
- A dynamic effect on the heading "Tahini, chickpeas, drizzle", one word over another.
- A slight sideways animation when hovering over the hamburger menu.
- When the menu is open, the hamburger should turn into a closing icon: "X". 
- When clicking on "Explore menu", the food-menu part of the one-pager should appear.
- You don't have to be able to close the cookie-bar. 
- You need only be able to close the menu on the closing icon, not when pressing a menu link. 

### Learning objectives & assessment
- CSS and SASS basics.
- Use semantic HTML.
- Validation of HTML and CSS.
- Accessability.
- The planning and implementation of design/layout. 
- Using lists, grids and flexbox.
- Responsiveness in regards to media queries. 
- Images, including accessability, SEO and best practice. 
- Link to another section of the page, anchor links. 
- Text effects.
- Import fonts. 
- Using icons. 
- Positioning and stacking. 
- Forms and fieldset.
- Good class naming practise, to make for structured and consistent CSS.

### Little about the process and thoughts
I might have restarted the initial part of the placment and grid systems 2 or 3 times before I elt I got a good enough structure to keep building on. I learned a ton about placement, planning ahead, and to always keep the next version of the layout in mind the whole way through, to make for as little code as possible. 
The goal was to not have to repeat code unnecessarily. 
I also learned a lot about sizing of images and why and how it affects the loading speed of the webpage.
